# RAGAS - AI Framework for Evaluating RAG Applications

## Overview
RAGAS is a specialized evaluation framework designed for **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** applications. It helps in assessment of the **accuracy, faithfulness, and relevance** of AI-generated responses in **LLM-powered systems**.

## Features
### 🔍 **Faithfulness Evaluation**
- Measures how well AI responses align with retrieved data.
- Detects **hallucinations** in LLM-generated content.

### 📌 **Contextual Relevance**
- Ensures the retrieved documents provide useful context.
- Helps optimize **retrieval mechanisms**.

### 📊 **Answer Precision**
- Evaluates if the AI-generated answers are **concise, correct, and unbiased**.

### 🏗 **Seamless Integration**
- Works with **LangChain, OpenAI, Hugging Face**, and more.
- Supports **RAG-based pipelines** for better AI performance.

### 🚀 **Customizable Metrics**
- Developers can define **custom evaluation metrics** based on application needs.

## Use Cases
- **Chatbots & Virtual Assistants** 🗣️ – Improves response accuracy.
- **Search Engines** 🔎 – Enhances information retrieval quality.
- **AI-driven Knowledge Systems** 📖 – Ensures data integrity.

# DeepEval: LLM Evaluation Framework

## Overview
DeepEval is an **open-source framework** designed to assess the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). It provides a structured approach to evaluating model outputs using various metrics, ensuring reliability and effectiveness.

## Key Features
- **Comprehensive Metrics**: Supports over 14 evaluation metrics, including:
  - **G-Eval**: Chain-of-thought reasoning for output assessment.
  - **Faithfulness**: Measures accuracy and reliability.
  - **Toxicity**: Detects harmful or offensive content.
  - **Answer Relevancy**: Evaluates alignment with user expectations.
  - **Summarization Quality**: Assesses coherence and completeness.
- **Synthetic Dataset Generation**: Enables controlled testing environments.
- **Integration with CI/CD**: Seamlessly fits into automated testing pipelines.
- **Security & Bias Detection**: Identifies vulnerabilities like prompt injections and bias.

## How It Works
1. **Define Evaluation Criteria**: Select relevant metrics for assessment.
2. **Create Test Cases**: Generate datasets for evaluation.
3. **Run Evaluations**: Apply metrics to assess LLM performance.
4. **Analyze Results**: Review reports and optimize model behavior.
